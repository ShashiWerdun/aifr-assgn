Assignment in course BITS F327 AI for Robotics.

### Problem Statement:
Explore the following pedometer website for the BPHC map and make a Graph representation of all the roads available in the map; https://www.gmap-pedometer.com/
- Junctions/Dead ends can be represented as a node of the graph, and path distances between these junctions can be taken as the edges of the graph. Represent this map in with the Dictionary structure of the Python.
- Make a plot and show this graph representation. Use any online library.
- Take a start node and a goal node and implement the Dijkstras algorithm as discussed in the class to find the shortest path.
- Write a code and find out the path with A* algorithm for the same start and goal node. Take heuristics as the distance found by DFS algorithm.
